## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `autom8.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for this application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar autom8.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add appointment c/CUSTOMER_ID d/DATE t/TIME`, `CUSTOMER_ID, DATE and Time` are parameters which can be used as `add appointment c/2 d/02/02/2023 t/2pm`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
